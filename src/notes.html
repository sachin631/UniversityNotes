1> transform :scale(1.02)
   //above property of css is used to add get up effect on the card component after hover

2>
    to add multiple component in single path then just add it after another use react fragments 

3>
    card styling problem solved by float left,mainly it is dependent on width each component get equal width
    now we have need to set width at 33.33% and used media query for mobile phone at 762

4>
    why i am not able to pass props to <Link to={props.url}>NEXT</Link> in Reactjs  
    i am create a card then from that single card i acces 9 card just by
    call it again and again i.e <card/><card/>.... and there is a next
    button in that card ,when i click that button i want to go at new
    component each time but when i pass props to <LINK
    to={props.url}>NEXT</LINK> then subject component(main component of card)
    is dissapper and nothing show

    solution: the error is that we can not pass props from each card,
    i.e error=>

.....above we pass url to only one subject we have to pass it to all
    i.e solution=>

    we have needto pass the props(url) to each its card(child) to access it


    when we want to import a file from src to folder inside src then write like that ../api
